### About Our Lab
<!-- {: style="text-align: center;"} -->

Welcome to the JC STEM Lab of Smart Cyber-Physical Industrial Systems. We explore the deep integration and interaction between cyber systems and physical systems to tackle practical industrial challenges. Our laboratory combines cutting-edge robotics, artificial intelligence, and advanced control systems to develop intelligent solutions for real-world industrial applications. We specialize in creating autonomous systems that can adapt to dynamic and uncertain environments, with a focus on practical deployment and engineering excellence.

Our research spans three core areas: **Cyber-Physical Systems** for intelligent integration of computation and physical processes, **Robotics** for autonomous manipulation and navigation, and **Data Analytics** for extracting insights and enabling data-driven decision making.

We leverage state-of-the-art robotic platforms including:
- Humanoid robots
- Quadruped robots
- Robotic arms
- Hexapods
- Automated vehicles

Highly motivated students interested in our research are encouraged to contact us. See our [projects](/projects/) and [research](/research/) for more details.
